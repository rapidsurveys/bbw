Description: The blocked weighted bootstrap (BBW) is an estimation technique 
    for use with data from two-stage cluster sampled surveys in which either 
    prior weighting (e.g. population-proportional sampling or PPS as used in 
    Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions or SMART 
    surveys) or posterior weighting (e.g. as used in rapid assessment method or
    RAM and simple spatial sampling method or S3M surveys). The method was 
    developed by Accion Contra la Faim, Brixton Health, Concern Worldwide, 
    Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition, UNICEF Sierra Leone,  UNICEF Sudan
    and Valid International. It has been tested by the Centers for Disease
    Control (CDC) using infant and young child feeding (IYCF) data. See Cameron
    et al (2008) <doi:10.1162/rest.90.3.414> for application of bootstrap
    to cluster samples. See Aaron et al (2016) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0163176> 
    and Aaron et al (2016) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0162462> for application 
    of the blocked weighted bootstrap to estimate indicators from two-stage 
    cluster sampled surveys.
