\title{Blocked Weighted Bootstrap}
\description{
The \code{blocked weighted bootstrap (BBW)} is an estimation technique for
use with data from two-stage cluster sampled surveys in which either prior
weighting (e.g. \code{population proportional sampling} or \code{PPS} as
used in \code{Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and
Transitions} or \code{SMART} surveys) or posterior weighting (e.g. as used in
\code{Rapid Assessment Method} or \code{RAM} and \code{Simple Spatial
Sampling Method} or \code{S3M} surveys). The method was developed by
Accion contra la Faim (ACF), Brixton Health, Concern Worldwide, Global
Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), UNICEF Sierra Leone, UNICEF Sudan and
Valid International. It has been tested by the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) using infant and young child feeding (IYCF) data.

\details{
The bootstrap technique is summarised in this
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)}{article}.
The \code{BBW} used in \code{RAM} and \code{S3M} is a modification to the
\code{percentile bootstrap} to include \code{blocking} and \code{weighting} to
account for a complex sample design.

With \code{RAM} and \code{S3M} surveys, the sample is complex in the sense
that it is an unweighted cluster sample. Data analysis procedures need to
account for the sample design. A \code{blocked weighted bootstrap (BBW)}
can be used:
\describe{
\item{\code{Blocked}}{The block corresponds to the primary sampling unit
(\eqn{PSU = cluster}). \code{PSUs} are resampled with replacement.
Observations within the resampled \code{PSUs} are also sampled with
replacement.}

\item{\code{Weighted}}{\code{RAM} and \code{S3M} samples do not use
\code{population proportional sampling (PPS)} to weight the sample prior to
data collection (e.g. as is done with \code{SMART} surveys). This means that
a posterior weighting procedure is required. \code{BBW} uses a
\code{"roulette wheel"} algorithm to weight (i.e. by population) the
selection probability of \code{PSUs} in bootstrap replicates.}
}

In the case of prior weighting by \code{PPS} all clusters are given the
same weight. With posterior weighting (as in \code{RAM} or \code{S3M})
the weight is the population of each \code{PSU}. This procedure is very
similar to the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_proportionate_selection}{fitness proportionate selection}
technique used in evolutionary computing.

A total of \eqn{m} \code{PSUs} are sampled with replacement for each
bootstrap replicate (where \eqn{m} is the number of \code{PSUs} in the survey
sample).

The required statistic is applied to each replicate. The reported estimate
consists of the \code{0.025th (95\% LCL)}, \code{0.5th (point estimate)}, and
\code{0.975th (95\% UCL)} quantiles of the distribution of the statistic across
all survey replicates.

Early versions of the \code{BBW} did not resample observations within
\code{PSUs} following:

\cite{Cameron AC, Gelbach JB, Miller DL, Bootstrap-based improvements for
inference with clustered errors, Review of Economics and Statistics,
2008:90;414â€“427 \url{doi.org/10.1162/rest.90.3.414}}

and used a large number (e.g. \eqn{3999}) survey replicates. Current versions of
the \code{BBW} resample observations within \code{PSUs} and use a smaller
number of survey replicates (e.g. \eqn{n = 400}). This is a more computationally
efficient approach
