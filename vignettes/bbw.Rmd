The **blocked weighted bootstrap** is an estimation technique for use with data from two-stage cluster sampled surveys in which either prior weighting (e.g. *population-proportional sampling* or *PPS* as used in **Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions** or **SMART** surveys) or *posterior weighting* (e.g. as used in **Rapid Assessment Method** or **RAM** and **Simple Spatial Sampling Method** or **S3M** surveys).

<br/>

The bootstrap technique is described in this [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)). The **blocked weighted bootstrap** used in **RAM** and **S3M** is a modification to the *percentile bootstrap* to include *blocking* and *weighing* to account for a *complex sample design*.

<br/>

With **RAM** and **S3M** surveys, the sample is complex in the sense that it is an unweighted cluster sample. Data analysis procedures need to account for the sample design. A *blocked weighted bootstrap* can be used:

<br/>

**Blocked**: The block corresponds to the primary sampling unit ($PSU = cluster$). *PSU*s are resampled with replacement. Observations within the resampled *PSU*s are also sampled with replacement.

**Weighted**: **RAM** and **S3M** samples do not use *population proportional sampling (PPS)* to weight the sample prior to data collection (e.g. as is done with **SMART** surveys). This means that a posterior weighting procedure is required. `bbw` uses a *"roulette wheel"* algorithm (see [Figure 1](#FIG1) below) to weight (i.e. by population) the selection probability of *PSU*s in bootstrap replicates.

<br/>

In the case of prior weighting by *PPS* all clusters are given the same weight. With posterior weighting (as in **RAM** or **S3M**) the weight is the population of each *PSU*. This procedure is very similar to the [fitness proportional selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_proportionate_selection) technique used in *evolutionary computing*.

<br/>

A total of $m$) *PSU*s are sampled with replacement for each bootstrap replicate (where $m$) is the number of *PSU*s in the survey sample).

<br/>

The required statistic is applied to each replicate. The reported estimate consists of the 0.025th (*95\% LCL*), 0.5th (*point estimate*), and 0.975th (*95\% UCL*) quantiles of the distribution of the statistic across all survey replicates.

<br/>

Early versions of the `bbw` did not resample observations within *PSU*s following:

<br/>

and used a large number (e.g. $3999$) survey replicates. Current versions of the `bbw` resample observations within *PSU*s and use a smaller number of survey replicates (e.g. $n = 400$). This is a more computationally efficient approach.

<br/>

The main reason to use `bbw` is that the bootstrap allows a wider range statistics to be calculated than model-based techniques without resort to grand assumptions about the sampling distribution of the required statistic. A good example for this is the confidence interval on the difference between two medians which might be used for many socio-economic variables. The `bbw` also allows for a wider range of hypothesis tests to be used with complex sample survey data.
