Description: The blocked weighted bootstrap (BBW) is an estimation technique 
    for use with data from two-stage cluster sampled surveys in which either 
    prior weighting (e.g. population-proportional sampling or PPS as used in 
    Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions or SMART 
    surveys) or posterior weighting (e.g. as used in rapid assessment method or
    RAM and simple spatial sampling method or S3M surveys) is implemented.
    The method was developed by Brixton Health, Global Alliance for Improved 
    Nutrition, UNICEF Sierra Leone, UNICEF Sudan and Valid International. It has 
    been tested by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) using infant and young 
    child feeding (IYCF) data. See Cameron et al (2008) <doi:10.1162/rest.90.3.414> 
    for application of bootstrap to cluster samples. See Aaron et al (2016) 
    <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0163176> and Aaron et al (2016) 
    <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0162462> for application of the blocked weighted 
    bootstrap to estimate indicators from two-stage cluster sampled surveys.
